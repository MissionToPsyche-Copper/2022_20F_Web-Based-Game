-----------Major Changes in Brief-------------
Magnetometer revamped and integrated into gameplay
Orbit trajectory line predicting player path
Auto magnifier for ship when far from asteroid
Togglable minimap with togglable focus
Popup notifications
Score trackers in UI and misc UI addons


-----------Tool Changes-------------
:::Magnetometer:::
>>>Revamp
Changed magnetometer ring from a circular orbit to an elliptical
Elliptical orbits require calculation for the length of both axises
Changed shape from "pipe" to "torus"
colliders consist of two "cylinders" acting as outer and inner edges of torus
Collider cylinders stretch with the Torus when fitting to elliptical orbit
Effect plays when player is in ring
Scoring for Magnetometer is based on consecutive time in the ring
- Score ramps up in multiplier (to a cap) based on time in ring


-----------Resource Use-------------
>>>ShipResources.cs
Magnetometer consumes some power (less than charge) while active in ring

>>>Resource UI
Changed the "animated" sprites of the UI bars to a static bar
- the shader invovled in those bars had issues with 3D objects in the gamefield


-----------Orbit Lines-------------
>>>OrbitLines.cs
Created a script the creates a predictive path of the player orbit
the script takes the players current velocity and gravity force to the asteroid
It samples 1 second incriments of that data to draw a LineRenderer
If the orbit will end up with a collision the line stop (though sometimes goes haywire)
if the orbit will be too wide (flying off into space) the line will not loop
Line can be toggled On/Off by pressing 'Spacebar'


-----------UI Updates-------------
>>>Magnifier
A "minimap" sized popup appears in the top right corner
this popup occurs if the player is too far from the asteroid
this is to assist seeing the attitude of the spacecraft while the MainCamera is zoomed out
This popup is NOT toggleable.  (it appears when it is needed automatically)

>>>MiniMap
Toggle minimap On/Off by pressing 'Q'
Toggle minimap focus by pressing 'E'
Minimap appears in the top left corner
Default minimap focus is directed as a whole picture of the asteroid
the alternate focus is a zoomed out look which shows the whole Magnetometer orbit

>>>PopUp Notifications
Small text notifications popup on screen at certain events
the text fades in, displays a notification for (default) 8secs then fades out
If a popup occurs while another is already displaying it will move old messages upwards
Popups can be called from any script using:
 PopMessageUI.PopUpMessage("your message text") for the default 8 second timer
or
 PopMessageUI.PopUpMessage("your message text", time) for a custom time (in seconds)

>>>Scores Information
Score information is now displayed at the top of the screen
Only score information for tools that are active in the scene (at scene load) will display
The scores pulled from the GameRoot scene scores information (not total game scores)
